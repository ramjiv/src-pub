# ZSH configuration

Zsh has some rather extreme and beautiful configuration options. This is by far no means a complete explanation or even a correct one - however there is a pretty decent zsh environment currently under my fingertips.

In general, I have run the brew-install documented elsewhere in this repo beforehand.


## .zshrc

Ideally this will become a blow by blow narrative of how things work for future reference, right now it's pretty raw.

```zsh
At some point I will do a breakdown of the content in here. But for now:

- Copy the file to your $HOME/.zshrc
- Run zsh --login or alternatively open a new shell if your default shell is zsh already
- Expect a few bugs :-) this relies on a few pre-requisites existing:
  - jump
  - bat
  - git
  - colorls (gem install colorls)
  - direnv

```
